# Brazilian Traffic Signs Recognition

This project focuses on developing neural networks structures that are capable of perform brazillian traffic signs classification. With that porpouse, OpenCV was used to create dataset and TensorFlow framework was used to build the neural networks. 

## Getting Started

In order to work locally with the files, you should clone the repository with the following command:
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/ML-Intel/traffic-signs.git
```

### Prerequisites

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) >= 4.1.11

This work uses [Intel Distribution for Python and Full Intel Performance Libraries](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-distribution-for-python-with-anaconda) wich contains all the necessary packages to run correctly the jupyter notebooks. **Please follow the instructions provided on the link**.


### Running

To run a Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory and run

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

Once in the Jupyter Notebook environment, navigate to **Report_v1.ipynb**.



## Built With

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
